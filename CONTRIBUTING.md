   ```

3. Create a new branch for your contribution:

   ```
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```

4. Make your changes, improvements, or fixes in your branch.

5. Commit your changes with clear and descriptive messages:

## Tips for Contributing

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/HemuManju/nasa-uli-xplane/issues) section for existing issues or features that need attention. You can also create new issues to discuss potential contributions.

- If you're adding a new feature or making significant changes, consider discussing your proposal with the community first by creating an issue or reaching out in the existing discussions.

- Follow the coding style and guidelines used in the project to maintain consistency.

- Write clear and comprehensive documentation for any new features or changes you introduce.

- Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected and do not break existing functionality.

- Be patient and responsive during the review process. Your contributions are valuable, and feedback helps improve the quality of the project.

## Code style

### Adhere to standard Python style guidelines

All contributions are checked against style guidelines described in PEP 8.

### Use consistent variable naming

Classes should be named using `CamelCase`. Functions and instances/variables should use `snake_case` (n_samples rather than nsamples). Avoid single-character variable names, unless inside a [comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-list-comprehension) or [generator](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-generators).

### We (mostly) follow NumPy style for docstrings

In most cases you can look at existing docstrings to figure out how yours should be formatted. If you can’t find a relevant example, consult the Numpy docstring style guidelines for examples of more complicated formatting such as embedding example code, citing references, or including rendered mathematics.
